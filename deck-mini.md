## 1. What We're Building

**DataVec is a new foundation for cloud services.**  
Like SQLite, but for servers—not a framework, but a runtime that fuses memory, logic, and state into isolated actors with zero glue.

Our actor runtime runs 300k QPS/core with just 104 KB per actor. Services like Redis, SQLite, or API handlers run natively—no orchestration, no log scraping, no cold starts.

## 2. Why Now

**Cloud costs are out of control.**  
Teams are burning out on coordination glue and observability tax. New services like Durable Objects and iCloud hint at locality—but miss performance and generality.

**DataVec delivers structure natively—on edge, on server, or self-hosted.**

---

## 3. Why Us

We've built ultra-high-scale systems before: 12 billion real-time requests/day in OpenRTB. We've also seen cloud cost postmortems firsthand—companies failing due to overhead.

We're systems thinkers and full-stack doers—already running production-grade infrastructure with observability and composability built in.

## 4. Vision

**We want to make the cloud lean again.**  
Our runtime enables structured, actor-based services that scale like serverless—but without the waste. Fixed-cost compute that’s fast enough to sell. Declarative protocols, no scaffolding.

We believe every service—from small apps to entire ecosystems—deserves structure, not glue.

## 5. Ask

**We’re raising a $1.5M pre-seed round** to polish the dev experience, launch our hosted platform, and grow the community around structured compute.

Let’s build the runtime that ends the cloud tax.
